# Diabetes_Readmission_Models
This is an project I did for one of my health data science classes.

It involves the prediction of patient readmission based on several variables such as drugs being taken, age range, sex, medical tests, etc.

I did two models (a Sequential and Random Forest) using three target classes (<30 day readmission, >30 day readmission, and no readmission). Then I
did the same two model types but with two target classes (<30 days and >30 days grouped with no readmission) because the hospital is not penalized 
if the patient comes back after more than 30 days.

The exploratory data analysis and model statistics are extensive, although they could still be better.

The models are somewhat good at what they do, but I have not optimized them too much. The results are within the Jupyter Notebooks.
